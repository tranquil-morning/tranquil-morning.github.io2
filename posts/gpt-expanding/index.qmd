[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)에서 제공하는 ChatGPT Prompt 강좌를 요약한 글입니다.
실제 OpenAI 개발자가 진행하는 강좌이기에, 단순히 이용자의 경험과 감으로 제공되는 prompt 보다 나을 것으로 예상하여 정리합니다.

모든 예시는 GPT 4.0 API로 작성되었습니다.

이번 문서에서는 제품 리뷰를 통해 글의 감정/주제를 추출하는 예제를 실행해보겠습니다.  
이용할 제품 리뷰는 다음과 같습니다:  

```s
<Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had \
additional storage and not too high of a price point. \
Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the \
transit and the company happily sent over a new one. \
Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put \
together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their \
support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! \
Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares \
about their customers and products!!>
```
